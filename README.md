It is a sweltering summer day and you are driving home from work when suddenly, your car starts to sputter and lose power. 
You realize that you are out of gas and need to find a gas station quickly. 
Fortunately, you have your cell phone with you, and remember that you recently downloaded an app called Petrl Pal, 
which shows the prices of gas at different stations in your area.
